# UpdateIP2PHP
Updates the external IP address of the device this is running on to a chosen server via PHP between a set time interval.

This was used for some server game prototyping and remote access testing of mine.

Example usage:

1. Leave your computer on at home, turn this program on, configure a php script to receive the updated ip at yourdomain.com/php?

2. At remote location, access yourdomain.com/ipcheck.php

3. Use the IP shown at the php html page to connect a remote desktop to your home computer or have a client-server app fetch it :)
